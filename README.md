Front End Server ... 
we made this server to send RES requests to catalog and order servers .


what you want to change ? 

there is one line to change to make the server work on your machine. 
line 177 make a connection with front_end_server to make invalidate request, so you have to change the previous front_end_server URL with 
your new front_end_server URL .
